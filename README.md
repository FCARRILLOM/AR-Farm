# AR-Farm
Xcode project that uses ARKit to create a surface on which 3D animals can be placed.

First, the app needs to find a flat horizontal surface. When it has identified one, it will place a green plane (grass) on the screen.

To add an animal select the animal on the picker, and tap the screen.
